# AI-Driven Waste Classification System

This project employs machine learning and computer vision to classify solid waste into categories such as recyclable, hazardous, food, and residual. Integrated with an automated recycling bin, the system opens the correct lid based on waste type, streamlining the recycling process. Designed for both environmental impact and educational use, it offers a hands-on way for children to learn about waste management and recycling.
